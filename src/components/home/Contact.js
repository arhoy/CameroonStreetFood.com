          This being a passion we are excited to share with you all, comes with
          its own limitations apparently. We apologise ahead. We are available
          to cater two days a week Friday and Saturdays. Orders must be placed
          one week prior to your event date. There are however a handful of West
          African Traditional dishes we can cater to not outlined here. Hit us
          up and LETS SERVE YOUR IMAGINATION!
